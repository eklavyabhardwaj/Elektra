EBT-2PL,Test Report Is Not Generated On Lan Printer,"Initially, one needs to check the basic steps for most of the printout problems:1Check whether the LANcable is connected properly behind the hardness tester&the LAN Port. If not fix it properly.2Check Ethernet PrinterSettingsin the tester. If required follow the below steps:Go to: Settings >> Reports >> Printer Settings >> Select: Ethernet Printer3.Enter proper IP Address for the LAN Printer after consulting the IT personnel.4.If the IP address has been recognized properly by the instrument, the SEND & RECEIVE signal will be seen in RED & GREEN at the right bottom display of the hardness tester.If not, check whether the lights are seen on the LAN port of the instrument when the LAN cable is inserted inside the slot.Note:-The Green light on the LAN port should be stable &the Orange light on the LAN port should blink indicating the data transmission between the instrument and the LAN.Important Tips: -1.LANprinting is possible in printers supporting post scriptseries 3 emulation feature in it.2. Examples of such printers are:HP 5200, HP P2015 Series, etc.cardCheck if the 14-pin FRC cable is properly fixed on the Processor card (J5) &the Compatch card (J4). If yes, check the continuity of pin no.1 to 14 on both sides of the cable. If not observed, replace the FRC cable. The cable should be a splitted one with insulation as shown below. If cable is proper, proceed to next step.Processor card Compatch card14 Pin FRC CableCheck whether the lights are seen on the LAN port of the instrument when the LAN cable is in-serted inside the slot.Note:-The Green lighton the LAN port should be stable &the Orange light on the LAN port should blink indicating the data transmission be-tween the instrument and the LAN.If there areno lights observed on the LAN port,replace the Compatch card.If LAN port is ok,With the support from the Electrolab Service Team or IT Team, connect an external router be-tween the instrument & PC/Laptop & then check the print data on Docklight application installed on PC/Laptop. If data is received on PC/Laptop, there is some problem with the IP assigned which needs to be resolved by the IT Team.If still print doesn’t come, reprogram the instru-ment with the latest firmware or replace the Pro-cessor card."
